# Avocado

This is a project that is based on a [kaggle challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/neuromusic/avocado-prices) which aims to predict the avocado prices given different features. check /avocado/README.md for further information.

The main goal of the project is not to accurately predict the prices but to demonstrate how different machine learning models can be used to solve a classification problem.

The following results are inferior relative to other approaches. A better performance can be reached in many ways, and thus I recommend you use these models as baselines.

Following are tips to boost your performance:
- approach the data as sequential data
- tune the hyperparameters
- build more sophisticated ensembles
- use formant algorithm to analyse the price sequences
- use deep learning
